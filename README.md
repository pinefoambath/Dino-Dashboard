# Object Oriented Javascript 

## Dino Dashboards

This project creates a dinosaur infographic. In this project I tried to practice object oriented JavaScript.

The repo takes user data via a form, and then compares the user - their height, diet - to that of eight dinosaurs. 

The repo is written in plain Javascript. No routes are needed, all DOM changes are managed in JS.

## View the Dashboard

- clone the respository locally
- run a local server, for example [Web Server for Chrome](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/web-server-for-chrome/ofhbbkphhbklhfoeikjpcbhemlocgigb/related?hl=en)
- Have fun interactiong with the dashboard!
