# Object Oriented Javascript 

## Dino Dashboards

This project creates a dinosaur infographic. In this project I tried to practice object oriented JavaScript.

The repo takes user data via a form, and then compares the user - their height, diet - to that of eight dinosaurs. 

The repo is written in plain Javascript. No routes are needed, all DOM changes are managed in JS.
